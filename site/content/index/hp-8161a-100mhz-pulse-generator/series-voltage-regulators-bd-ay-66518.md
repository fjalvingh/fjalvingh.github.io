Voltage checks

U10 (+12v reg) seems to have been replaced .

Providing -22 and +22 delivers 12v on tp17 and -12v on tp18. Adding the +6.6V on red gives a 5V output on pin 4 of J1. The voltage reference also gives nice +5.0020V (R95 trimmer). I cannot check ripple on the output because Iâ€™m providing input from my lab psu.
