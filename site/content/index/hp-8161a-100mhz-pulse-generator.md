# HP 8161A 100MHz Pulse Generator

I got this device from Ebay, “for parts only”. The top and bottom panels were missing, and it appeared to have suffered a fall as the metal panels that contained the card sliders were misaligned.

The hobby part is to try to restore this beautiful device :wink:

- 8160A service manual (the one for the 8161A cannot be found, and many of the parts really seem to be the same as the 8160A. Most boards are actually numbered as 08160, and some have a little plate soldered over the 8160 number with 8161 on it.).
