# 9825A Initial checks

# Power supply check

Checking the voltages on the PSU:

| **Voltage** | **Measured** | **Requirements** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| +12V | 11.875V | 11.95 to 12.05 |
| +5V | 5.03V | 4.9 to 5.15 |
| +7V | 7.038V | 6.9 to 7.1 |
| \-12V | \-12.10 | \-12.5 to -11.5 |
| \-5V | \-5.01 | \-5.2 to -4.8 |

The 12V is very slightly under spec, but I will leave it for now.

The PSU seems to be OK, but I’ll wait until I have the parts for a crowbar circuit to prevent repeating CuriousMarc’s adventures.
