Problems:

- R107 vaporized completely (51.1 ohm, wattage?)
- C177 died as a victim of R107â€™s demise (2.2 uF bipolar 63v mkc 61)
- vr106 suspect
- r108, r109 exploded (12.1 ohm 1W)
- Q101, Q102 of course died too (BUS12 Philips, 400V 125W 8A (DC)/20A (AC), NPN)

That BUS12 will be hard to get, and replacements apparently too - there does not seem to be a lot of use of the TO-3 housing anymore 8-/
